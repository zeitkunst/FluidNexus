= SECURITY NOTE =

Data is stored unencrypted in a local sqlite database.  It is best that you take care of encryption yourself, such as by using ecryptfs home directories or LUKS encrypted devices on Linux.

Data is sent over bluetooth without any transport layer encryption.  This is something we plan on implementing in the future.
