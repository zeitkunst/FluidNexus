This software is ALPHA QUALITY and should only be used at your own risk.  More detailed instructions about theory, motivation, installation, and use can be found on the website.

The software has been testing on Ubuntu Maverick with python 2.6.6 and requires the following python modules: pyqt4, python-qt4-dbus, sqlalchemy, textile, pybluez, protobuf (version 2.3.0 or higher).  Ideally the software will work unmodified for bluetooth on Windows with the requisite libraries, but that has not been extensively tested.  Zeroconf will require some changes.  Mac OS X will require the use of a different bluetooth library such as lightblue; zeroconf is another question altogether.

To run, type "./FluidNexus.py"; for help, type "./FluidNexus.py --help".

The Nokia Series 60 port is on hold for the moment; archived code can be found in the "S60" directory.

= SECURITY NOTE =

Data is stored unencrypted in a local sqlite database.  It is best that you take care of encryption yourself, such as by using ecryptfs home directories or LUKS encrypted devices on Linux.

Data is sent over bluetooth without any transport layer encryption.  This is something we plan on implementing in the future.

= TODO =

* Move current zeroconf implementation to pybonjour (requires installation of avahi compat library: libavahi-compat-libdnssd1)
* Fix TextBrowser size in GUI
* * Almost there...still off by a bit
* Shutdown server/client threads properly on GUI exist
* Start server/client threads in headless version; shutdown properly by catching interrupts
* Implement zeroconf
* Implement ad-hoc wifi
* Implement SSL/TLS over the network modalities
