#   INSTALLATION
#############################################################################

At the moment, the installation of Fluid Nexus is not easy nor quick.  We recommend that if you do not have experience installing and using third-party software on your phone that you wait for a later release of Fluid Nexus.

1.  Download both the Python interpreter ("PythonForS60_") _and_ the Python Script Shell ("PythonScriptShell_") for your particular mobile phone, depending on what version of Symbian you use (1st, 2nd, or 3rd Edition): http://opensource.nokia.com/projects/pythonfors60/

2.  Install these programs on your phone using your favorite method: Bluetooth, data cable, etc.

3.  Download the Fluid Nexus archive.

4.  Transfer the files "FluidNexusClient.py" and "FluidNexusServer.py" to your phone.  If using the Bluetooth to transfer the files, install them as "Python Script" _not_ "Python Library Module".

5.  The next steps are different based on what type of phone you are running:
    * For 1st or 2nd Edition: install FluidNexus.sis.
    * For 3rd Edition: install the rest of the scripts in the archive.

6.  To run the application:
    * For 1st or 2nd Edition: Select "Fluid Nexus" from the menu
    * For 3rd Edition: Start the "Python" application.  From the "Options" menu, select "Run Script".  Navigate to a file called "my\default.py".  Select this script to start the application.

#   CAVEATS
#############################################################################

 * The application, client, and server consume a large amount of phone resources.  I have taken some attempts to reduce the consumption, but you will likely have to restart your phone after an hour or so of using Fluid Nexus.
 * Sometimes messages are not sent even though the application finds other phones running Fluid Nexus.  This is either a bug or a problem in Bluetooth service discovery.
 * New messages do not automatically appear in your message list.  You have to restart the application to see them.

Each of these caveats will hopefully be addressed in the next version of Fluid Nexus.
