SOONER
======

* Figure out how to make a debian package, upload to PPA; this necessitates making packages for pybonjour and oauth2 as well
* Add created time to message display
* Shutdown server/client threads properly on GUI exit
* Present dialog instead of status message if bluetooth, zeroconf are not enabled

LATER
=====

* Ensure both received and posted time show up in UI
* Fix TextBrowser size in GUI
* * Almost there...still off by a bit
* Start server/client threads in headless version; shutdown properly by catching interrupts
* Implement ad-hoc wifi
* Implement SSL/TLS option over the network modalities
